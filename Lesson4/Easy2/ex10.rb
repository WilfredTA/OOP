The benefits to using OOP in Ruby abound...
For example, as a procedural language, Ruby is able to increase the tenability
of complex programs due to its syntactical "sugar"..
As an object oriented program, we reap the benefits of being able to handle
incredibly complex programs. 
Through the use of encapsulation to hide the irrelevant details
Through the use of collaboration to construct interfaces between custom objects
Through the use of modules to increase our ability to customize classes 
when hierarchical inheritance is not sufficient
Through the intuitve power lent to us by the OO model, we can construct
scenarios that are more isomorphic to the world itself. 
Through the elimination of the need to repeat our code.
Through these means, OOP in Ruby gives us the power to handle complexity 
without sacrificing comfort
